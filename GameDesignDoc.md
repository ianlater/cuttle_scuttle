The player plays as a cuttlefish going to save his girlfriend from a chinese 
restaurant. He starts out at sea, and goes into the harbor and then the city 
during the game. The difficulty increases as time goes on and the cuttlefish 
is ultimately(sadly) unable to rescue his girlfriend.

The game is a sidescroller where the cuttlefish is always swimming forward.
However, the cuttlefish can be moved about onscreen by the W,A,S,D. 



  *Dolphins attack the player by seeking the player and biting him.

  *Whales do not seek, but are large obstacles on the screen that must be dodged
  *or they will push the character off screen.

  *There will be little schools of fish that can appear and swim around for brief
  *periods of time before swimming away. The player can hypnotize these schools by
  *holding down the right mouse button and shoot them at enemies by aiming with the
  *mouse and shooting with left mouse button.



  *Crabs will appear at random and scuttle across the bottom of the screen and can 
  *be eaten for more health.

  *Fisherman appear randomly at 
  *the top of the screen and have fishing lines in the water with hooks that move
  *up and down. If the cuttlefish is caught(collides with the hooks), then the
  *player is reeled away and loses. However, if the player does not impale the hook from above or if
   the player is knocked off by a whale the player may survive. 

The player earns points constantly as long as he is not hit. If he is hit,
then there is a deduction(score can be negative). The player can get score
multipliers for killing enemies which end as soon as the character is hit.
There are no lives, but instead a health bar. 

The game ends when the player dies.
